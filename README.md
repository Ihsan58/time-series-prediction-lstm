LSTM-Based Time Series Prediction Pipeline
This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for time-series prediction using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, and API deployment for making predictions.

Features
Data Preprocessing:

Cleans data by handling missing values.
Adds moving averages (5-day and 20-day) as features.
Scales numerical features for compatibility with LSTM.
Model Training:

Builds and trains an LSTM-based neural network.
Uses lagged sequences as input to predict the "Close" price of a time series.
Saves the trained model for deployment.
API Deployment:

Serves predictions via a Flask API.
Accepts JSON input with feature data and returns model predictions.
Setup and Usage
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
Required libraries:
Copy code
pandas
scikit-learn
tensorflow
flask
2. Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/time-series-lstm-pipeline.git
cd time-series-lstm-pipeline
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Data Preprocessing
Run the preprocess_data.py script to preprocess the raw dataset:

bash
Copy code
python preprocess_data.py
Input: data/eur_usd.csv (raw dataset).
Output: data/processed_data.csv (preprocessed dataset).
4. Model Training
Train the LSTM model using the preprocessed data:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Input: data/processed_data.csv.
Output: src/lstm_model.h5 (trained model).
5. Running the API
Start the Flask API for predictions:

bash
Copy code
python api.py
The API will run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

6. Making Predictions
Send a POST request to the /predict endpoint with JSON input:

json
Copy code
{
  "features": [
    [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9], 
    [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]
  ]
}
Example request using curl:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"features": [[0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9], [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]]}'
Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "prediction": [[1.23456], [1.34567]]
}
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and feature engineering.
Scikit-Learn: Data scaling and preprocessing.
TensorFlow/Keras: Building and training the LSTM model.
Flask: API deployment.
Future Improvements
Implement validation and early stopping during training.
Optimize the model architecture for better performance.
Add Docker support for containerized deployment.
Deploy the API to cloud platforms like AWS or Heroku.
